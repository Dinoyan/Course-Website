Some issuses that we noticed with the old CSCB20 website is there a quarte of whitespace on the right hand side of the site when you view in its full size. The header does not fully extend to the right side of the browser. All the content were pushed to the left side of the screen. And right side was just blank. Appearance wise, it wasn't that great. Overall the design of the site is quite dull, with no icons, and just two blue rectangles as main design of the site. 

For our site we made sure that our icons, header, footer and information took up all the space on the page and there wasn't a consistent whitespace seen through out the whole site. We used custom icons to add style to each of the buttons. We added custom icons to because we all know that pictures worth a thousand words. Therefore this gives the user more info about the pages. And for our footer we used the UofT symbol and linked the CMS site through the symbol. We tried to fit all the information in just one page without the need of scrolling for user friendly. But still managed to keep the information spread out, without being squeezed togeather.

Some issuses that we faced when building this site was some merge conflicts that we ran into when using github to work on this assignmnet. We fixed this issue by, Both of us worked on different pages instead of us both working on the same HTML file. We also ran into some issuses with the footer, where some of the info would hide under the footer when you resize the page.
